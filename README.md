# QuestBook: Your Videogame-Inspired To-Do List
---

### Introduction
Welcome to QuestBook! This project merges some subtle video game concepts with the functionality of a to-do list, making task management an engaging and enjoyable experience. QuestBook allows users to create and manage 'Quests' - each representing a project with its own set of tasks.

---

### Key Features
1. **Create Quests:** Users can add new quests, each a blank slate for tasks to be added. Quests may be deleted via the trashcan icon when selected.
2. **Task Management:** Within each quest, users can add tasks. Each task can be marked as complete and/or deleted.
3. **Night Mode:** Upon clicking the moon icon, users will be met with a sleek, dark navy blue theme that's easy on the eyes. This mode is perfect for night owls.
4. **Ambient Background Music:** Featuring "Littleroot Town" from Pokémon Omega Ruby/Alpha Sapphire for an immersive experience. This can be toggled on or off.
5. **Customizable Icons:** Users can click on the tree icon to access the icon selection feature, adding a personalized touch to their QuestBook.

### Technologies Used
- **JavaScript:**
- Dynamic Interactivity: Implemented advanced JavaScript features to create a dynamic user interface that responds to user interactions.
- Object Constructors: Practiced OOP principles by using object constructors (e.g., function ToDo) for creating task objects with properties like title, due date, priority, and completion status. This approach enhanced the scalability and maintainability of the code.
- **HTML5:** Focused on semantic HTML for structured and accessible content.
- **CSS:**
- Responsive Design: Employed CSS techniques like Flexbox and CSS Grid for responsive layouts, ensuring the app adapts to different screen sizes.
- Custom Animations: Added custom animations and transitions to enrich the visual appeal and user interaction.
- **Webpack:** Leveraged Webpack for bundling modules and assets, optimizing the application’s load time and performance.

### How to Use QuestBook
1. **Create a Quest:** Start by clicking "New Quest" in the sidebar to create and name your first quest.
2. **Add Tasks:** Break down your quest into manageable tasks. Open your quest by clicking its name, and click the "+" icon to add a task.
3. **Track Progress:** Check off tasks as you complete them. You may also delete tasks.
4. **Enjoy the Music:** Let the background music enhance your experience. If you prefer a silent environment, toggle the mute button to switch it off.
5. **Personalize Your View:**
